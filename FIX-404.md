# Quick Fix for Vercel CSS 404

The CSS file exists in Git but Vercel returns 404. This usually means:

1. **Vercel deployed an old commit** - Check your Vercel dashboard
2. **Build configuration issue** - Vercel might be looking in wrong directory
3. **Cache issue** - Vercel's CDN cached the 404

## Immediate Fix

I'm going to:
1. Touch the CSS file to update its timestamp
2. Make a dummy commit to force Vercel to redeploy
3. This will trigger a fresh build

Stand by...
